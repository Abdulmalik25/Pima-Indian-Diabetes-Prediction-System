An end-to-end machine learning system that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. This project integrates exploratory data analysis, model training, feature engineering, evaluation, and deployment via an interactive Streamlit web application.

üéØ Project Goal

To develop and deploy a real-time diabetes prediction system that:

Accurately identifies diabetic and non-diabetic individuals

Evaluates multiple classification algorithms

Presents results through a clean and interactive UI using Streamlit

üìä Dataset Overview

Source: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from the UCI repository

Records: 768 patients

Features: 8 clinical variables

Pregnancies

Glucose

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness (removed in final model)

Insulin

BMI

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

Target Variable: Outcome (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic)

üß† Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning

Replaced biologically implausible zeroes (e.g., Glucose = 0) with NaN

Imputed missing values with column means

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualized distributions using box plots and violin plots

Identified correlations between features and diabetes outcome

3. Outlier Handling

Applied IQR method to cap/floor outliers for key features

4. Feature Engineering

Scaled features using StandardScaler

Created interaction terms:

Insulin/Glucose ratio

BMI/Age ratio

Pregnancy x BMI product

5. Balancing the Data

Applied SMOTE to balance class distribution before model training

6. Model Training

üåê Deployment with Streamlit

An interactive UI was built using Streamlit to allow users to:

Input patient details (glucose, BMI, insulin, age, etc.)

Get real-time prediction and confidence score

Access the model in a clean, user-friendly interface

‚úÖ Conclusion

Multiple models were evaluated, with Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression performing the best.

AUC scores confirm strong discrimination ability, especially with ensemble methods.

The Streamlit interface transforms the model into a practical, accessible tool for healthcare insights.
